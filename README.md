# exprobj.py
*A math library designed for all your quick command-line calculations*

## Important warning

This library is NOT intended to be used in another program/code : this code wasn't written with speed and performances in mind, but practicality of use.
It is made for quick calculations that you would do in a terminal for a math/physics project.

Furthermore, it is very probably buggy as hell, so I thank you in advance for all bug reports and feature requests.

### Status

This library is still in development, and is not yet ready for use.
Here is a list of the features and their status:
