# exprobj.py
*A math library designed for all your quick command-line calculations*
***

## Important warning

This library is NOT intended to be used in another program/code because, even though it works, this code wasn't written with speed and performances in mind (heck I'm using Python), but practicality of use.
It is made to facilitate calculations that you would do for a math/physics project.

Furthermore, it is very probably buggy as hell, so I thank you in advance for all bug reports and feature requests.

### Status
